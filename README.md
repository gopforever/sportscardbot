## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### 1. Get Sports Card Pro API Key (Recommended)

**Why Sports Card Pro?**
- ✅ Specifically designed for sports cards
- ✅ Provides actual market values and sales data

**How to Get API Key:**
1. Visit [Sports Card Pro API Documentation](https://www.sportscardspro.com/api-documentation)
2. Sign up for API access
3. Get your API key
4. Note rate limits and pricing tiers

### 1.5. Alternative: Get eBay API Keys (Legacy)

If you prefer to use eBay API instead:

1. Go to [eBay Developer Program](https://developer.ebay.com/)
2. Sign up or log in with your eBay account
3. Navigate to **"My Account" > "Application Keys"**
4. Click **"Create an Application Key"**

   - Application Title: "Sports Card Bot" (or your choice)
   - Select: "I want to use eBay APIs"
6. Once approved, you'll receive:
   - **App ID (Client ID)** - This is your `EBAY_APP_ID`

- ✅ Sports card-specific data and pricing
- ✅ Includes grading information (PSA, BGS, SGC, etc.)
- ✅ Market values based on actual sales data
- ✅ No production approval wait time

2. Get your **Sandbox** keys (available immediately under "Sandbox Keys")
3. Add to `.env`: `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`
4. Test the bot with sandbox data

**Upgrading to Production:**

1. Request production access at https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
2. Wait for eBay approval (1-3 business days)
3. Update `.env` with production keys
4. Change `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production`
5. Restart bot for real eBay data

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gopforever/sportscardbot.git

- Filter by grade for investment-quality cards: `"PSA 10"`, `"BGS 9.5"`
- Search by year and set: `"2023"` + `"Topps Chrome"`
- Leave some fields empty for broader searches

**eBay (Legacy):**
- Include player name: `"Michael Jordan"`

- Include card set: `"2023 Topps Chrome"`
- Combine specifics: `"LeBron James Prizm Silver PSA 10"`

**Analysis Settings:**
- Higher discount threshold = fewer but better deals
- More sold days = more reliable data but less responsive to trends
- Higher min samples = more reliable but may miss opportunities

## 🕷️ eBay Web Scraping

This tool includes an optional eBay web scraping feature to find underpriced cards by comparing eBay listings against Sports Card Pro market values.

### Important Notes

- ✅ **For personal use only**
- ✅ **Rate-limited** to be respectful of eBay's servers (2-second delay between requests)
- ⚠️ **eBay's Terms of Service** technically prohibit automated scraping
- ⚠️ **Could be blocked** if used aggressively or at high volumes
- ⚠️ **Not for commercial resale** or high-volume automated trading
- ⚠️ **Use at your own risk** - understand the legal implications

### How It Works

1. **Gets market values** from Sports Card Pro API for specific cards
2. **Scrapes eBay** for current Buy It Now listings of those cards
3. **Compares** eBay listing prices vs Sports Card Pro market values
4. **Identifies** cards listed significantly below market value
5. **Displays** opportunities in the dashboard with discount percentages

### Enabling eBay Scraping

1. Select **Sports Card Pro** as your API source in the dashboard
2. Check the **"Enable eBay Scraping"** option in the sidebar
3. Configure your search (player, sport, year, set, etc.)
4. Click "Search for Deals"
5. The bot will:
   - Query Sports Card Pro for market values
   - Scrape eBay for current listings
   - Compare prices and show arbitrage opportunities

### Respectful Usage

The scraper is designed to be respectful:
- **2-second delay** between requests (configurable)
- **Limited to 50 results** per search by default
- **Proper User-Agent headers** to identify as a browser
- **Error handling** for when eBay changes HTML structure
- **Rate limiting** prevents aggressive scraping

### What Gets Scraped

From each eBay listing, the scraper extracts:
- Title
- Price (Buy It Now)
- Shipping cost
- Condition
- Item URL
- Image URL

### Legal & Ethical Considerations

**Important Legal Notice:**
- Web scraping may violate eBay's Terms of Service
- This feature is provided for **educational and personal use only**
- Do not use for commercial purposes or automated trading
- Do not use at high volumes that could burden eBay's servers
- The authors are not responsible for any misuse or consequences

**Best Practices:**
- Use sparingly and only for personal research
- Don't scrape more frequently than necessary
- Don't scrape large volumes of data
- Respect eBay's robots.txt file
- Consider the ethical implications of automated scraping

### Troubleshooting Scraping

**"No listings found" when scraping:**
- eBay may have changed their HTML structure
- Your IP may be temporarily blocked (wait and try again later)
- Try a different search query
- Disable scraping and use Sports Card Pro data only

**Slow performance:**
- The 2-second delay between requests is intentional
- This is necessary to avoid being blocked by eBay
- Be patient - each search query takes time

**Blocked by eBay:**
- Wait several hours before trying again
- Reduce scraping frequency
- Consider using a VPN (though this may violate ToS)
- Switch to Sports Card Pro only mode (no scraping)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Sports Card Pro API credentials not configured!"

**Solution:** Make sure you've:
1. Created a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`)
2. Added your actual `SPORTSCARDPRO_API_KEY` from Sports Card Pro
3. Restarted the Streamlit app

### "Invalid API key" or 401 Errors

**Solution:**
- Verify your API key is correct in `.env`
- Check that there are no extra spaces or quotes
- Ensure your Sports Card Pro account is active
- Contact Sports Card Pro support if issues persist

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solution:**
- Sports Card Pro has rate limits (typically 60 requests/minute)
- Wait a few minutes before searching again
- Consider upgrading to a higher tier for more requests
- The bot automatically rate-limits to respect API limits

### "eBay API credentials not configured!" (Legacy)

**Solution:** Make sure you've:
1. Created a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`)
2. Added your actual `EBAY_APP_ID` from eBay Developer portal
3. Restarted the Streamlit app

### "500 Internal Server Error" or Production API errors

**Solution:**
- Production API access requires eBay approval (1-3 business days)
- Switch to sandbox environment while waiting for approval:
  1. Set `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` in `.env`
  2. Use sandbox API keys from eBay Developer portal
  3. Restart the app
- Once production access is approved, switch back to `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production`

### "No opportunities found"

**Possible causes:**
- Discount threshold too high - try lowering it
- Search filters too specific - try broader terms
- Price filters too restrictive - widen the range
- Market conditions: cards may be fairly priced at the moment

**For Sports Card Pro:**
- Try searching with fewer filters
- Use more popular players or sets
- Adjust the price range

**For eBay:**
- Not enough sold listings - try increasing sold_days or decreasing min_sold_samples
- Use more generic search terms

### "Insufficient sold listings"

**Solution:**
- Lower `min_sold_samples` in sidebar or config.yaml
- Use more generic search terms
- Increase `sold_days` to look further back

### API Rate Limit Errors

**Sports Card Pro:**
- The bot automatically rate-limits to 60 calls/min
- Check your plan's limits on the Sports Card Pro dashboard
- Consider upgrading for higher limits

**eBay (Legacy):**
- The bot automatically rate-limits to 50 calls/min
- If you hit daily limits (5,000 calls), wait 24 hours
- Consider upgrading to eBay's paid tier for more calls

### Connection/Timeout Errors

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- API may be temporarily down - try again later
- Increase timeout in `sportscardpro_client.py` or `ebay_client.py` if needed

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

- ✅ Never commit `.env` file to version control
- ✅ Use environment variables for API keys
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Don't share your API keys publicly
- ✅ Review `.gitignore` to ensure secrets are excluded

## 📊 Understanding the Metrics

### Market Value Calculation

**Sports Card Pro:**
- Uses Sports Card Pro's proprietary market value algorithm
- Based on actual sales data from multiple marketplaces
- Regularly updated for accuracy
- Includes grading and condition adjustments

**eBay (Legacy):**
The bot calculates market value using:
- **Average Price** - Mean of all sold listings
- **Median Price** - Middle value of sold listings
- **Weighted Average** - Recent sales weighted more heavily (used as market value)

### Discount Percentage
```
Discount % = ((Market Value - Active Price) / Market Value) × 100
```

### Profit Potential
```
Potential Profit = Market Value - Active Price
Profit Margin % = (Potential Profit / Active Price) × 100
```
